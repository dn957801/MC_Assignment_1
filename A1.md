Additionally, for each application, you must include TWO heuristic evaluations of the application (please refer to Section 6 for Usability Heuristics, by Jakob Nielsen). Focus only on answering the questions listed under each usability heuristic. Your submission should include specific examples for each guideline observed (or not) in the application. If one of the guidelines is not followed (or, not applicable for the application you have chosen), then, write “not observed” (or “not applicable”), and justify why it was not observed (or, is not applicable). Try to find as many concrete reasons why some aspect of the application fails/passes. Examine if other elements fail/work well. Strive for a clear and concise answer.
